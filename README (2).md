# 🌿 Cardamom Leaf Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

This repository contains our undergraduate research on detecting cardamom plant diseases using deep learning techniques. We applied and compared CNN models to classify leaf images as **Healthy**, **Phyllosticta Leaf Spot**, or **Blight**.

## 📌 About the Research

Cardamom crops are prone to diseases that reduce yield and quality. This research proposes a deep learning-based solution to detect diseases early using leaf images, helping farmers take timely action.

## 🧠 Methods Used
- **CNN Models**: ResNet50, VGG16, DenseNet121
- **Approach**: Transfer Learning & Feature Fusion (Hybrid Model)
- **Dataset**: Custom-labeled images of cardamom leaves
- **Preprocessing**: Image resizing, normalization, augmentation

## 🧪 Research Outcomes
- Compared model performance using precision, recall, and loss
- Developed a lightweight interface for real-time prediction
- Proposed a hybrid CNN model that outperformed standalone models

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📱 System Features
- Upload leaf images for instant classification
- Works on desktop and mobile browsers
- Supports batch prediction

## 📈 Future Work
- Explore Vision Transformers (ViT), ConvNeXt, EfficientNetV2
- Add environmental data (humidity, soil, weather)
- Improve usability for field deployment
